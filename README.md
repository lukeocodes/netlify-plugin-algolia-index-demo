## Usage of the plugin

To install, add the plugin in your `netlify.toml`. No config is required but we show the default options here.

<details>
<summary><b>Generating the search index file.</b></summary>

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = netlify-plugin-algolia-index
    # all inputs is optional, we just show you the defaults below
    # [plugins.inputs]
      # exclude = [] # don't index this file
      # publishDirJSONFileName = searchIndex
```
</details>

Default config will exclude nothing and generate a JSON file at `https://yoursite.netlify.com/searchIndex.json`

## More plugin options

#### Exclude files

Your project probably contains some content files that you don't want your users to search. Pass an array of paths (or regex) to the files you donâ€™t want to be indexed to dismiss them:

```yml
[[plugins]]
  package = netlify-plugin-algolia-index
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['/admin', '/404.html']
```
